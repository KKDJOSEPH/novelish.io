Website for project 2 in [CS5610 Web Development](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2021/). The goal was to build a web application that demonstrated our ability to incorporate node.js, express, and 2 MongoDB collections. Our project is a book directory that allows you to review and rate books and see reviews from others. You can watch a video demo of our site here(link not added yet).
